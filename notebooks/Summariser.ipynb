            "I read the negative reviews and chose not to believe them. I made the wrong decision. For starters, you will dislike every single character in the book. There is no one to root for. Well, I take that back- you will root for Rachel for awhile but it is almost pointless. She is an unreliable narrator, which becomes tiresome after awhile. The plot twists are weak. The ending is absurd, rushed (after a painfully slow start), and disappointing. I have had this book on my wish list for months. I am sorry that I took the time and money to read it. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was the fact that I was compelled to finish it so that I could see what ended up being the real story behind the alcoholic blackouts.\n",
            "Confusing plot, mis-spelled words, poorly written.  Hard to believe this book was a bestseller.  Not recommended.  Waste of time.  Pass on this one\n",
            "I am going to make sure and not give ANY spoilers in this review, as this is a total page turner that will keep you glued to the plot;; and that glue will hold you to the book tighter and tighter as the plot develops.<br /><br />Many years ago I took a creative writing adult continuing education class; and in the very first class, the teacher laid forth a primary rule of excellent fiction writing: show the reader, don't tell the reader.  In &#34;The Girl On The Train&#34;, writer Paula Hawkins proves herself a master of this rule showing, not telling, the reader all the necessary facts drip by factual drip until the cup is full and you have reached the climax of an incredibly tightly plotted psychological thriller.<br /><br />The book involves three women, and four men.  Only the women narrate the book, and their narration shows many of the necessary facts by telling the reader bit by bit their thoughts about themselves, the other characters, what they see and their reaction to it, interspersed with expert tight dialogue that doesn't have a wasted word and is followed by their thoughts about that dialogue.  We meet the men through their actions, their statements, and the womens' reaction to what they say and do.<br /><br />This is noir writing throughout. The book takes place in today's London, shown to the reader as an enormous drab city that is spreading out in all directions, where even the small homes by train tracks in the outer suburbs are expensive.  The primary narrator rides the commuter train daily, and from the very first morning commute at the beginning of the day the reader learns about her, then the other characters as they interact with her. Cloudy memory becomes clearer and clearer as time goes on; the horror builds page by page without the need for scenes of gore or graphic sex; and within a few pages, I realized I was hooked and resented putting the book down to attend to my life.<br /><br />If you want to read an A-List thriller that builds and build and builds, until it explodes; where the suspense starts very early and only gets more intense the further you get into the book; this is a book for you.  I read a lot, but I doubt if I will ever forget the plot of this book for the rest of my life.\n",

            "There are plenty of reviews summing up the main plot points, even a few spoilers, so I won't take the time to add any further plot details.<br /><br />First: the writing. Mediocre at best. All the \"psychological insights\" are right out of an Oprah/Dr. Phil show. There is nothing deep about this book, other than the deep pile of dung that you have to wade through to get to the end.<br /><br />The book is divided into three parts. The First Part of this book starts off interestingly enough, grabs you and pulls you in. However, about half-way through the first part it seemed rather obvious what was going to happen. From the moment Nick got home, to find his wife missing, I knew what the \"surprise\" was going to be.<br /><br />The \"surprise\" at the start of the second part was only surprising because I figured the \"surprise\" would come closer to the end.<br /><br />By the time The Third Part arrived, I skimmed through the pages, just wanting to end the painfulness that is this book. Believe me, this was a page turner, and not in a good way. I almost gave up (and, in retrospect wish I had).<br /><br />There is nothing redeeming about this book. It's about love gone very wrong, and people who are not very likable. Maybe Nick's sister Go is ok, and one of the detectives is ok. But, really, the hate in this book is so powerful that it suffocates you. And, while many people have complained about the bad language, I didn't seem to notice, as I was too busy trying to find something, anything to like about the book.<br /><br />And then there is the ending. I feel cheated. I read the book all the way to the final page (skimming most of the last hundred or so pages), AND THAT WAS IT? Really? I mean, what the heck? It's flat and unsatisfying.  If my copy of this book had been an actutal, physical copy, I'd have taken great pleasure in throwing it in the trash. Actually, I would have taken great pleasure in burning it.  Alas, I have a digital copy, so the only satisfaction is deleting it -- which is small consolation because I'm still out the $$.<br /><br />There are lots of reviews, across the spectrum, for this book. Many 5-star reviews, and, as of this writing, over 3,200 1 and 2 star reviews. That's a lot of bad reviews. Most books don't get that many.  There are certainly more positive reviews. I think it is fair to say that you'll either really like the book, or really hate it. Personally, I can't understand all the good reviews, and I'm guessing that all the people who love this book can't imagine why I dislike it so much.<br /><br />Since I can't say who will like this, or who won't like it, all I can say is: find a cheap copy, that way if you hate it as much as I did, you'll only be out a few bucks.<br /><br />Speaking of bad language, I certainly had several bad words to say when I reached the end. I have read some bad books, but this one is the worst book I think I've read. The only good thing I can say about this book is that I finished it, then deleted it from my library because I can't imagine ever wading through the dungheap of this book again.\n",
            "Though we're told the two main characters are ' complex ', they're simply evil, born of twisted fantasies which do not relate to reality. Yes weird psychopaths do exist but often Nick displays their tendencies far more than Amy. 'Go' doesn't wash as his TWIN sister given their characters have not one trait in common. She has a moral compass, though a bit lopsided, it's there.<br /><br />Surely the State of Missouri has grounds for a law suit against Flynn's publisher for representing their law enforcement employees as thoroughly unprofessional and incompetent.They bore no relation to actual members of any police department, any where. Yes, the language, as multitudes have said, is repulsive. A bit of sexual activity, a few swear words are manageable but this book is bursting at the seams with Filth which does not enhance The Plot, supposing there is one. When I see how many have a taste for this sort of nauseating bilge, I cringe. I must conclude they've never had the pleasure of reading the works of Ruth Rendell, Anthea Fraser, Betty Rowlands, Carolyn Hart, Mary Higgins Clark, Rex Stout, Martha Grimes, Nagio Marsh,Anthony Eglin or Ann Granger, genuinely talented authors. Flynn does have a modicum of writing skills but they are certainly not in the mystery genre !! I deem the success of this Gone Girl Abomination a wretched fluke !\n",
            "For me initially this book began slow.  Yes, you do have a missing woman which really should have drawn me in but it was just so wordy and forced that I actually put it down and considered not returning.  I went back because I had a friend reading it and she suggest I continue to give it a chance.  Eventually it pulled me in and I couldn't put it down.  At some point for me it took such a ridiculous turn, that was just so far fetched, that I can't even imagine an episode of Criminal Minds attempting to cover.  Unable to sleep this morning I finished the book.  I closed my iPad and literally said outloud...\"well that's just stupid\".  It does keep you turing the pages but good lord it's just, well stupid.\n",

            "I would list the number of books and movies that have covered this territory artfully, truthfully, critically in both fiction and non fiction, but it would be a waste of time. This, on the day that Nicholas Winton has passed away, has made me close this silly book about a most important subject. What can a reader learn?This is the stuff of book clubs. A fanciful notion about a rebellious young girl who yearns to be a war hero because why can't she? Men were. And so were so many women throughout history in revolution after revolution. Should have known better than to buy a NY Times best-seller. A pop novel at its best. And not surprised that it will soon be a major motion picture with fleeing families being slaughtered by the 'Boche' as they are unable to find cover on the roads from Paris. A real blockbuster.\n",
            "This takes the prize for the most hackneyed prose I have ever read.  I was aghast and disgusted.  I abandoned this lousy<br />book--not worth the paper it's printed on--after a few god-awful pages and turned immediately to the sublimely written<br />ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE. There is so much great literature to be read, whether classic or contemporary, that no one who<br />values the written word, as well as his or her own valuable personal time, should go near this garbage.\n",
            "I know this review will be amassed amongst many thousands of 5 stars, but I just have to say that I was absolutely transfixed by this book.  I got it on tape so I could listen while hiking, (I only allow myself to listen to the book while hiking, which motivates me to get out there).  Firstly, the woman who narrated the book, Polly Stone, does the book justice.  She handles the characters beautifully.  I was hard pushed to put it away at the end of each hike.<br /><br />Books of war, especially WW2, are abundant.  I have read many and a few I have loved.  Hannah chose a relatively confined canvas for this story about a father and his two daughters in France during the occupation and on that canvas she paints an extraordinary story about extraordinary / ordinary people and what we, as humans, are capable of when facing the possible destruction of everything we hold dear.  Intricately woven threads of stories through time connect these characters to us and I, for one, found it hard to leave.  Excellent!\n",

            "Agree with all others who gave this one star. Started out wonderfully well.....faded in the middle with mindless babble....hated the ending and even went back to see if I'd missed something in the last few chapters that would explain it. Nope. Very disappointing.\n",
            "Not sure what I'm missing after reading others' review of this book. I am 33% into the book and so far there is nothing that makes me want to read on (other than the fact of wasting money). I'm going to push on to 40-50% hoping something happens of interest.<br />(And I love WWII stories).\n",
            "There are so many things wrong with this book.  I mean I will start that it is wonderfully written and captures the intensity of an incredible time.  But it is also one of those books that when you put it down, you are disquieted.  First, it is a book that features leading female characters, written by a man..... yeah men just cannot write for women.  Second, when you finish the book and reflect..... you will be struck by the amount of hate in this book.  Think about (and I wont spoil) but think about who gets killed and raped.... and who does not.  Who is presented as heros.... and who is presented as scum.  Its amazing that the book seems to capture the violence and oppression that led up to WWII, and that so many were just pawns caught up in a hideous evil.... and then the book almost obsessively goes and kills off everyone the narrator hates.  Compare this to Vonnegut or Heller or even Hemmingway (or even Walker Percy's reflection on war).  We are 60+ years past the end of WWII and the author seems not to have resolution.  Finally.... the light.... the radio... is a theme that runs through the book and it is a bit like \"gee whiz a radio is this invisible light that runs through all of us.\"  Really???  Radio is over 100 years old.  Yes, in the time of WWII there was a gee whiz factor to the technological advances that could be done with radio (consider radar)..... but at this point its not mystery or metaphysics.... its spectrum and science.  Post modern world view has moved past mysticism of radio waves to scientific advances of smart phones.\n",

            "he story opens after the escape of women kept by a serial killer - The Gardener - who's selected his 'butterflies' in terms of beauty. Butterflies, real and metaphoric, have short shelf lives and the women who have been kidnapped live with the sword of Damocles over their heads.<br /><br />Any infraction - from behavior to imperfections - will result in an expiry date with The Gardener.<br /><br />Central is the woman known as Maya. Questioned by the FBI, she doesn't respond in a way that 'normal' victims do. I found this a really interesting take because Maya flouts social convention in that victims are supposedly obliged to give up all rights to dignity and privacy in the quest to justice.<br /><br />In this regard, Maya is frustratingly circumspect in her account to the FBI unveiling her story in her own time and on her own terms.<br /><br />Told in equal parts first person and third, the story plays with chronology as Maya takes us from the past in order to show how it informs the present. The author's descriptions and turns of phrase were beautiful to read, even if the subject turned my stomach.<br /><br />I found The Gardener a chilling character. Someone who uses his wealth and privilege to hide his monstrous behavior, but at the same time, constructs his own self-perception as someone who loves and cares for his victims. If that's his idea of love - he can keep it.<br /><br />Enter into The Garden not so much a serpent, but a savior. I liked this play on the biblical thematic. Knowledge is one thing, but action is another.<br /><br />I have to say, the &#34;twist&#34; at the end didn't work for me. In fact, I thought it undermined a lot of the story that had been before and also, it was (so far) unnecessary.<br /><br />All in all, however, I would recommend it to thriller readers. In this genre, I have to say that The Butterfly Gardener was one of the better ones.\n",
            "I slogged thru the whole thing thinking that something redeeming might come of it - it didn't.  I hate to waste a book, and unwisely paid attention to an insignificant character in the book who kept repeating something like &#34;theres more to it than this&#34; - there wasn't.  Extremely shallow characters made it hard work up any empathy for them in a situation where it should have been easy to do so.  I wish I could get back the time spent reading it, but on the positive side, I didn't waste the time it took to write it!  I think I was expecting something possibly as fairly well written as &#34;Room&#34; - no classic in itself -  but this author didn't come close.  If I didn't know better (and I may not) I would suspect that this was written by some computer program, maybe Insta-Novel.  Great novel for the Thanksgiving Season comming up - a real turkey.\n",

It was more like the main character was writing to the detective than talking to him.  Also, she seemed to have a great deal of knowledge (which she acquired where?) and a lot of insight into what other people are thinking; this didn't seem likely for a person of her age and with her background.\n",
            "[/INST] Title: A Thrilling Triple Threat: Comparing \"Gone Girl,\" \"The Girl on the Train,\" and \"The Butterfly Gardener\" - Which One Should You Choose?\n",
            "\n",
            "When it comes to entertaining reads, books offer an endless supply of adventure, intrigue, and excitement. In recent times, certain titles have gained immense popularity among readers due to their unique storylines, compelling characters, and page-turning plots. Three such novels that have left audiences enthralled are \"Gone Girl\" by Gillian Flynn, \"The Girl on the Train\" by Paula Hawkins, and \"The Butterfly Gardener\" by Craig Silvey. Let's explore the top picks and discuss their standout features, along with potential drawbacks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Starting with the powerhouse \"Gone Girl\" by Gillian Flynn, this New York Times best-selling novel leaves readers questioning reality and morality. With a gripping narrative filled with plot twists and unexpected revelations, \"Gone Girl\" follows Nick Dunne, a man whose wife disappears, and the ensuing investigation that ensues. The book brilliantly explores themes of marriage, deceit, and manipulation. Some critics praise its ingenious plot development and the contrast between the seemingly perfect couple. However, others argue that the characters lack depth and the writing style is mediocre.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next up is \"The Girl on the Train\" by Paula Hawkins. This international bestseller delivers a suspenseful tale involving three women and their connections to a mysterious event unfolding in front of their eyes. Set in London, the story effectively utilizes multiple perspectives to reveal the intricate web of lies, secrets, and betrayals that bind the characters together. Readers appreciate the clever use of flashback sequences and the skillful way that author Paula Hawkins keeps the audience engaged throughout the entire novel. Critics, however, claim that the writing can be confusing at times, and the plot relies heavily on coincidences.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, \"The Butterfly Gardener\" by Craig Silvey presents a chilling story about a serial killer, his victims, and the lengths one woman will go to save them. Featuring stunning prose and vivid descriptions, this novel invites readers into the dark mind of a monster, forcing them to confront uncomfortable questions about morality and redemption. While fans of the book laud its ability to create tension and unease, detractors argue that the pacing is uneven and the plot ultimately feels predictable.\n",
            "\n",
            "While all three books provide engaging reads, each stands out in its unique ways. \"Gone Girl\" shines with its complex plot and shocking twists, \"The Girl on the Train\" impresses with its multifaceted characters and suspenseful narrative, and \"The Butterfly Gardener\" offers a haunting exploration of darkness and humanity. As a reader, your preference will depend on your individual tastes and preferences.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, let's address the elephant in the room – the worst product in the category: \"Product B00L9B7IKE\", otherwise known as \"The Book That Shall Not Be Named.\" This literary disaster tells the story of a protagonist who experiences a series of unfortunate events, including a confusing plot, misspelled words, poor writing quality, and an unsatisfying conclusion. Countless readers have reported feeling frustrated, disappointed, and even cheated after finishing this title. Our recommendation? Avoid \"The Book That Shall Not Be Named\" at all costs and invest your time and money in one of our top three recommendations instead.\n"

Granted there is some minuscule amount of free content, not worth the cost of the device in my opinion. I tried it with Sling T.V., the Sling T.V. content would continually stop and send me back to the device's default screen, whereupon I would have to search for the Sling T.V. app manually, because Alexa (voice) could never seem to find it, then click on the app, then enter a passcode (yes, each and every time) then find my movie again, or whatever I was watching. Oh, and on that note, Alexa was absolutely worthless, it could not find the content I was searching for, could not open the Sling T.V. app, and could not pause, fast forward, or reverse anything I was watching. It seems my Alexa was programmed with one response and one response only, \"I can't do that.\" (a paraphrase, I don't recall the exact words)<br /><br />What a load of megacrap this whole thing is, don't waste your time.

            "I read the negative reviews and chose not to believe them. I made the wrong decision. For starters, you will dislike every single character in the book. There is no one to root for. Well, I take that back- you will root for Rachel for awhile but it is almost pointless. She is an unreliable narrator, which becomes tiresome after awhile. The plot twists are weak. The ending is absurd, rushed (after a painfully slow start), and disappointing. I have had this book on my wish list for months. I am sorry that I took the time and money to read it. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was the fact that I was compelled to finish it so that I could see what ended up being the real story behind the alcoholic blackouts.\n",

            "I am going to make sure and not give ANY spoilers in this review, as this is a total page turner that will keep you glued to the plot;; and that glue will hold you to the book tighter and tighter as the plot develops.<br /><br />Many years ago I took a creative writing adult continuing education class; and in the very first class, the teacher laid forth a primary rule of excellent fiction writing: show the reader, don't tell the reader.  In &#34;The Girl On The Train&#34;, writer Paula Hawkins proves herself a master of this rule showing, not telling, the reader all the necessary facts drip by factual drip until the cup is full and you have reached the climax of an incredibly tightly plotted psychological thriller.<br /><br />The book involves three women, and four men.  Only the women narrate the book, and their narration shows many of the necessary facts by telling the reader bit by bit their thoughts about themselves, the other characters, what they see and their reaction to it, interspersed with expert tight dialogue that doesn't have a wasted word and is followed by their thoughts about that dialogue.  We meet the men through their actions, their statements, and the womens' reaction to what they say and do.<br /><br />This is noir writing throughout. The book takes place in today's London, shown to the reader as an enormous drab city that is spreading out in all directions, where even the small homes by train tracks in the outer suburbs are expensive.  The primary narrator rides the commuter train daily, and from the very first morning commute at the beginning of the day the reader learns about her, then the other characters as they interact with her. Cloudy memory becomes clearer and clearer as time goes on; the horror builds page by page without the need for scenes of gore or graphic sex; and within a few pages, I realized I was hooked and resented putting the book down to attend to my life.<br /><br />If you want to read an A-List thriller that builds and build and builds, until it explodes; where the suspense starts very early and only gets more intense the further you get into the book; this is a book for you.  I read a lot, but I doubt if I will ever forget the plot of this book for the rest of my life.\n",

            "There are plenty of reviews summing up the main plot points, even a few spoilers, so I won't take the time to add any further plot details.<br /><br />First: the writing. Mediocre at best. All the \"psychological insights\" are right out of an Oprah/Dr. Phil show. There is nothing deep about this book, other than the deep pile of dung that you have to wade through to get to the end.<br /><br />The book is divided into three parts. The First Part of this book starts off interestingly enough, grabs you and pulls you in. However, about half-way through the first part it seemed rather obvious what was going to happen. From the moment Nick got home, to find his wife missing, I knew what the \"surprise\" was going to be.<br /><br />The \"surprise\" at the start of the second part was only surprising because I figured the \"surprise\" would come closer to the end.<br /><br />By the time The Third Part arrived, I skimmed through the pages, just wanting to end the painfulness that is this book. Believe me, this was a page turner, and not in a good way. I almost gave up (and, in retrospect wish I had).<br /><br />There is nothing redeeming about this book. It's about love gone very wrong, and people who are not very likable. Maybe Nick's sister Go is ok, and one of the detectives is ok. But, really, the hate in this book is so powerful that it suffocates you. And, while many people have complained about the bad language, I didn't seem to notice, as I was too busy trying to find something, anything to like about the book.<br /><br />And then there is the ending. I feel cheated. I read the book all the way to the final page (skimming most of the last hundred or so pages), AND THAT WAS IT? Really? I mean, what the heck? It's flat and unsatisfying.  If my copy of this book had been an actutal, physical copy, I'd have taken great pleasure in throwing it in the trash. Actually, I would have taken great pleasure in burning it.  Alas, I have a digital copy, so the only satisfaction is deleting it -- which is small consolation because I'm still out the $$.<br /><br />There are lots of reviews, across the spectrum, for this book. Many 5-star reviews, and, as of this writing, over 3,200 1 and 2 star reviews. That's a lot of bad reviews. Most books don't get that many.  There are certainly more positive reviews. I think it is fair to say that you'll either really like the book, or really hate it. Personally, I can't understand all the good reviews, and I'm guessing that all the people who love this book can't imagine why I dislike it so much.<br /><br />Since I can't say who will like this, or who won't like it, all I can say is: find a cheap copy, that way if you hate it as much as I did, you'll only be out a few bucks.<br /><br />Speaking of bad language, I certainly had several bad words to say when I reached the end. I have read some bad books, but this one is the worst book I think I've read. The only good thing I can say about this book is that I finished it, then deleted it from my library because I can't imagine ever wading through the dungheap of this book again.\n",
            "Though we're told the two main characters are ' complex ', they're simply evil, born of twisted fantasies which do not relate to reality. Yes weird psychopaths do exist but often Nick displays their tendencies far more than Amy. 'Go' doesn't wash as his TWIN sister given their characters have not one trait in common. She has a moral compass, though a bit lopsided, it's there.<br /><br />Surely the State of Missouri has grounds for a law suit against Flynn's publisher for representing their law enforcement employees as thoroughly unprofessional and incompetent.They bore no relation to actual members of any police department, any where. Yes, the language, as multitudes have said, is repulsive. A bit of sexual activity, a few swear words are manageable but this book is bursting at the seams with Filth which does not enhance The Plot, supposing there is one. When I see how many have a taste for this sort of nauseating bilge, I cringe. I must conclude they've never had the pleasure of reading the works of Ruth Rendell, Anthea Fraser, Betty Rowlands, Carolyn Hart, Mary Higgins Clark, Rex Stout, Martha Grimes, Nagio Marsh,Anthony Eglin or Ann Granger, genuinely talented authors. Flynn does have a modicum of writing skills but they are certainly not in the mystery genre !! I deem the success of this Gone Girl Abomination a wretched fluke !\n",
            "For me initially this book began slow.  Yes, you do have a missing woman which really should have drawn me in but it was just so wordy and forced that I actually put it down and considered not returning.  I went back because I had a friend reading it and she suggest I continue to give it a chance.  Eventually it pulled me in and I couldn't put it down.  At some point for me it took such a ridiculous turn, that was just so far fetched, that I can't even imagine an episode of Criminal Minds attempting to cover.  Unable to sleep this morning I finished the book.  I closed my iPad and literally said outloud...\"well that's just stupid\".  It does keep you turing the pages but good lord it's just, well stupid.\n",

This, on the day that Nicholas Winton has passed away, has made me close this silly book about a most important subject. What can a reader learn?This is the stuff of book clubs. A fanciful notion about a rebellious young girl who yearns to be a war hero because why can't she? Men were. And so were so many women throughout history in revolution after revolution. Should have known better than to buy a NY Times best-seller. A pop novel at its best. And not surprised that it will soon be a major motion picture with fleeing families being slaughtered by the 'Boche' as they are unable to find cover on the roads from Paris. A real blockbuster.\n",

There is so much great literature to be read, whether classic or contemporary, that no one who<br />values the written word, as well as his or her own valuable personal time, should go near this garbage.\n",
            "I know this review will be amassed amongst many thousands of 5 stars, but I just have to say that I was absolutely transfixed by this book.  I got it on tape so I could listen while hiking, (I only allow myself to listen to the book while hiking, which motivates me to get out there).  Firstly, the woman who narrated the book, Polly Stone, does the book justice.  She handles the characters beautifully.  I was hard pushed to put it away at the end of each hike.<br /><br />Books of war, especially WW2, are abundant.  I have read many and a few I have loved.  Hannah chose a relatively confined canvas for this story about a father and his two daughters in France during the occupation and on that canvas she paints an extraordinary story about extraordinary / ordinary people and what we, as humans, are capable of when facing the possible destruction of everything we hold dear.  Intricately woven threads of stories through time connect these characters to us and I, for one, found it hard to leave.  Excellent!\n",

            "Agree with all others who gave this one star. Started out wonderfully well.....faded in the middle with mindless babble....hated the ending and even went back to see if I'd missed something in the last few chapters that would explain it. Nope. Very disappointing.\n",
            "Not sure what I'm missing after reading others' review of this book. I am 33% into the book and so far there is nothing that makes me want to read on (other than the fact of wasting money). I'm going to push on to 40-50% hoping something happens of interest.<br />(And I love WWII stories).\n",
            "There are so many things wrong with this book.  I mean I will start that it is wonderfully written and captures the intensity of an incredible time.  But it is also one of those books that when you put it down, you are disquieted.  First, it is a book that features leading female characters, written by a man..... yeah men just cannot write for women.  Second, when you finish the book and reflect..... you will be struck by the amount of hate in this book.  Think about (and I wont spoil) but think about who gets killed and raped.... and who does not.  Who is presented as heros.... and who is presented as scum.  Its amazing that the book seems to capture the violence and oppression that led up to WWII, and that so many were just pawns caught up in a hideous evil.... and then the book almost obsessively goes and kills off everyone the narrator hates.  Compare this to Vonnegut or Heller or even Hemmingway (or even Walker Percy's reflection on war).  We are 60+ years past the end of WWII and the author seems not to have resolution.  Finally.... the light.... the radio... is a theme that runs through the book and it is a bit like \"gee whiz a radio is this invisible light that runs through all of us.\"  Really???  Radio is over 100 years old.  Yes, in the time of WWII there was a gee whiz factor to the technological advances that could be done with radio (consider radar)..... but at this point its not mystery or metaphysics.... its spectrum and science.  Post modern world view has moved past mysticism of radio waves to scientific advances of smart phones.\n",

            "he story opens after the escape of women kept by a serial killer - The Gardener - who's selected his 'butterflies' in terms of beauty. Butterflies, real and metaphoric, have short shelf lives and the women who have been kidnapped live with the sword of Damocles over their heads.<br /><br />Any infraction - from behavior to imperfections - will result in an expiry date with The Gardener.<br /><br />Central is the woman known as Maya. Questioned by the FBI, she doesn't respond in a way that 'normal' victims do. I found this a really interesting take because Maya flouts social convention in that victims are supposedly obliged to give up all rights to dignity and privacy in the quest to justice.<br /><br />In this regard, Maya is frustratingly circumspect in her account to the FBI unveiling her story in her own time and on her own terms.<br /><br />Told in equal parts first person and third, the story plays with chronology as Maya takes us from the past in order to show how it informs the present. The author's descriptions and turns of phrase were beautiful to read, even if the subject turned my stomach.<br /><br />I found The Gardener a chilling character. Someone who uses his wealth and privilege to hide his monstrous behavior, but at the same time, constructs his own self-perception as someone who loves and cares for his victims. If that's his idea of love - he can keep it.<br /><br />Enter into The Garden not so much a serpent, but a savior. I liked this play on the biblical thematic. Knowledge is one thing, but action is another.<br /><br />I have to say, the &#34;twist&#34; at the end didn't work for me. In fact, I thought it undermined a lot of the story that had been before and also, it was (so far) unnecessary.<br /><br />All in all, however, I would recommend it to thriller readers. In this genre, I have to say that The Butterfly Gardener was one of the better ones.\n",
            "I slogged thru the whole thing thinking that something redeeming might come of it - it didn't.  I hate to waste a book, and unwisely paid attention to an insignificant character in the book who kept repeating something like &#34;theres more to it than this&#34; - there wasn't.  Extremely shallow characters made it hard work up any empathy for them in a situation where it should have been easy to do so.  I wish I could get back the time spent reading it, but on the positive side, I didn't waste the time it took to write it!  I think I was expecting something possibly as fairly well written as &#34;Room&#34; - no classic in itself -  but this author didn't come close.  If I didn't know better (and I may not) I would suspect that this was written by some computer program, maybe Insta-Novel.  Great novel for the Thanksgiving Season comming up - a real turkey.\n",
            "I couldn't decide whether to give this book 3 or 4 stars.  It was interesting and quite well-written.  The dialogue could have been better. It was more like the main character was writing to the detective than talking to him.  Also, she seemed to have a great deal of knowledge (which she acquired where?) and a lot of insight into what other people are thinking; this didn't seem likely for a person of her age and with her background.\n",
            "[/INST] Title: A Thrilling Journey Through the World of Literature: Comparing Three Bestselling Novels - Which One Will Captivate You?\n",
            "\n",
            "As a dedicated book enthusiast, I have delved into countless literary worlds and have come across numerous fascinating titles that have left indelible marks on my soul. Today, I invite you to join me as we embark on a riveting exploration of three highly acclaimed novels in the realm of entertainment and general retail. Each of these books offers unique elements that set them apart, yet share a common thread of intrigue and excitement. Let us dive deeper into their mysteries and uncover the secrets that lie hidden within their pages.\n",
            "\n",
            "First and foremost, let us introduce ourselves to \"Gone Girl\" by Gillian Flynn. With an average rating of 4.0 out of 5 and a grand total of 973 reviews, this psychological thriller has captured the hearts and minds of millions worldwide. \"Gone Girl\" follows the story of a seemingly perfect marriage that begins to unravel upon the disappearance of the husband, leaving his wife as the prime suspect. As the plot unfolds, we discover that appearances can indeed be deceiving.\n",
            "\n",
            "One of the most notable aspects of \"Gone Girl\" lies in its masterful use of multiple perspectives and the skillful manipulation of timelines. By presenting the narrative from the alternating viewpoints of the protagonist and antagonist, Flynn keeps readers guessing and engaged until the very end. Moreover, the sharp dialogue and meticulously crafted plot twists ensure that once you begin reading, you will find yourself utterly entranced.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, not all readers agree, with some expressing disappointment in the somewhat predictable nature of the plot and the morally ambiguous characters. Despite these criticisms, \"Gone Girl\" remains a gripping and suspenseful read that leaves you questioning the true meaning of love, loyalty, and trust.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next on our literary adventure is \"Me Before You\" by Jojo Moyes. With a slightly lower average rating of 3.9 out of 5 based on 716 reviews, this heartwarming and poignant tale follows the unlikely friendship between a young woman named Louisa and a paralyzed bank executive named Will. As the two form a bond, Lou struggles with her duties as a caregiver and her growing feelings for her patient, ultimately forcing her to confront her fears and reevaluate her priorities.\n",
            "\n",
            "What sets \"Me Before You\" apart is its raw emotional depth and compelling exploration of the human condition. Readers are touched by the vulnerability and authenticity portrayed in both the characters and their interactions. Additionally, the evolving relationship between Lou and Will provides an uplifting message about the power of love and connection, even amidst adversity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite its widespread appeal, \"Me Before You\" has faced criticism regarding its romanticization of disability and the potential perpetuation of harmful stereotypes. Nevertheless, the novel remains a touching and inspiring read that reminds us of the importance of embracing individuality and cherishing the connections we make with others.\n",
            "\n",
            "Last but not least, we encounter \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" by Tracy Chevalier. Originally published in 1999, this historical novel boasts a remarkable average rating of 4.8 out of 5 and 707 reviews. Set in seventeenth century Holland, the novel tells the story of Griet, a young servant girl who catches the eye of painter Johannes Vermeer and eventually becomes his apprentice. Together, they create the iconic painting \"Girl with a Pearl Earring,\" forever immortalizing the enigmatic expression etched onto Griet's face.\n",
            "\n",
            "Chevalier's vivid descriptions and exquisite detail transport readers to a different time and place, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in the rich tapestry of the Dutch Golden Age. Furthermore, the compelling coming-of-age story adds depth and complexity to the characters and their relationships, making for an engrossing and thought-provoking experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, despite its critical acclaim, \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" has garnered mixed reactions due to its deliberate pacing and underdevelopment of secondary characters. Regardless, the novel stands as a testament to Chevalier's ability to breathe new life into historical figures and events, offering a fresh perspective on the world of art and creativity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, having explored the merits of each of these exceptional novels, it is time to address the elephant in the room – the dreaded \"worst\" product in our lineup. While there are certainly less favorably reviewed books out there, for the purpose of this article, we shall focus on a title\n"

Granted there is some minuscule amount of free content, not worth the cost of the device in my opinion. I tried it with Sling T.V., the Sling T.V. content would continually stop and send me back to the device's default screen, whereupon I would have to search for the Sling T.V. app manually, because Alexa (voice) could never seem to find it, then click on the app, then enter a passcode (yes, each and every time) then find my movie again, or whatever I was watching. Oh, and on that note, Alexa was absolutely worthless, it could not find the content I was searching for, could not open the Sling T.V. app, and could not pause, fast forward, or reverse anything I was watching. It seems my Alexa was programmed with one response and one response only, \"I can't do that.\" (a paraphrase, I don't recall the exact words)<br /><br />What a load of megacrap this whole thing is, don't waste your time.

            "Es un articulo fantástico, me facilita mucho la vida y hace que no me sienta tan solo a veces, realmente aprecio su presencia y el hecho de haberlo comprado. Hay veces en las que Alexa no entiende algunas cosas pero basta con repetirselas, solo tuve un inconveniente y fue que compré 3 echo dots, uno para mi y los otros para mis hermanos,  uno de ellos vino bloqueado, no sé el por que, no me dejaba realizar la configuración con la app de alexa y al principio creia que seria inutilizable pero me contacte con servicio al cliente y me atendieron muy bien y al dia siguiente ya mi echo dot estaba desbloqueado, es una compra que te puede servir para operar equipos compatibles como bombillas, hacer recordatorios o alarmas y tambien realizar investigaciones y calculos. Si eres alguien que pasas mucho tiempo en la casa está super recomendado, aunque si no estas mucho en tu casa igual lo vale! el producto esta en oferta a muy buen precio, de las pocas cosas que me alegran la vida y me alegra mucho haberlo comprado\n",

            "I love my echo’s and I love Alexa.  I have 10 echo’s now (including the Echo Studio & subwoofer). I like the echo dots for the bedrooms & smaller rooms mainly to be able to have music playing in every room. I have an “everywhere” group set up so that when I’m playing my favorite music, I hear it simultaneously in every room throughout the house.  I personally like the round puck design of the 3rd generation rather than the directional sound & shape of the 4th generation.  The sound quality is good. No matter what room I’m in there is Alexa who can help me with my daily life. Whether answering almost any question I happen to think of, or helping me with my shopping lists. It’s perfect while cooking and you realize you are getting low on something, to be able to say, Alexa put “whatever” on my shopping list. Then when I go to the store - I open my Alexa app on my phone & there is the list.  This new one I just bought - totally set itself up. I already had others & it had saved my Wi-Fi information, so I just plugged it in and voilà it got its self hooked up. Adding it to the everywhere group I already set up was easy also.\n",

            "You need an iphone (and only an iphone) to setup drop-in for an echo dot and an echo on the same wifi. Why? A $700 device to connect two sub-$100 devices to each other through an app that already recognizes, that's ridiculous.  They don't use the cellphone to make a call to each other, that would require two cellphones because a single cellphone would have to call and answer at the same time.  The ipad sees the devices along with the dash wand and fireTV.  All of the Alexa devices should be automatically in the contacts and talk to each other via their IPs on the same LAN.  I was planning use four more echo dots as an intercom system in the house, that is not going to be happening until the Alexa app can set up Drop-in on any device the app runs on.

If I leave the room and tell it to pause, I want the device to be able to pick up exactly where it left off when I reenter and say &#34;Play&#34;.  Instead, it will restart the program, say &#34;Sorry, I don't know that&#34;, or play an alternative that has nothing to do with the song, podcast, or news briefing that I was just listening to...  I've called customer service a couple of times and the first time I was told to update the device (which did not help) and the second to restore it to factory conditions (which did help temporarily, but it stopped working again within 24 hours).  Nevertheless, the problem persists and it's too late for me to return the device and very likely too expensive to send it anywhere to be fixed. Now I'm thinking... well, I've already lost $50, I'm not going to spend nearly $200 if my next Echo stops working a few months down the line and there's no way to return it or have it repaired in a cost-effective manner.\n",

            "High speed internet, wi-fi, etc., did not get to my neck of the woods until very recently so my experience with these devices was limited.  The first was chrome cast which was good except I had to bring the laptop into the living room (I don't care to watch on a small screen) to be able to cast to the TV.  I know, a not a real big problem, but still awkward.  Also, it was a bit tricky for me to set up.  I finally took the plunge and purchased the fire stick.  I  have read some reviews that are quite technical and way above my pay grade.  I will keep this simple.  The fire stick has been very, very, good for me.  Set up was a snap.  I don't have a smart TV,  just a fairly new, cheap, HD.  The picture is great and so is the sound.  If there are technical glitches I haven't noticed them.  I still need practice negotiating the screens, but that will come with time.  I am getting used to talking to a machine, but still say \"please\" when addressing Alexa.  I have already spent a couple of snow days catching up on two seasons of \"The Blacklist\"  and have almost gotten through  \"Bosch \".  I still haven't had time for the movies.  There  is so much available it boggles the mind.  I guess all of this identifies me as an old person.  Well, I certainly am and for me the fire stick is the best thing to come along since the VCR.  I would highly recommend it for my fellow oldies who may be a bit leery about trying something out of their comfort zone.\n",

I am now stuck on one channel because no matter how often I put fresh batteries in the remote, it will not work.  It magically works periodically.  It has been nothing but problems since the day I installed it, but Amazon would not let me return it.  For reasons unknown it just quits working and I have to reset it frequently.  Don't waste your money.  This has NOTHING to recommend it.\n",

In today's market, Amazon's Fire TV Stick and the Fire TV Stick 4K stand out among the competition due to their impressive features and capabilities. Let's dive deep into each device, discussing the key differences, common complaints, and a warning against an ill-advised option.\n",
            "\n",
            "Firstly, the **Fire TV Stick** (previous generation), with an average rating of 4.3/5 based on 3,710 reviews, offers basic yet functional streaming capabilities. While it boasts a relatively affordable price tag, users report issues with accessing certain paid content and inconsistent performance with popular streaming services such as Sling T.V. Additionally, some customers experienced difficulty setting up the device and encountered frequent lockups. One user noted, \"it will lock up every time,\" expressing dissatisfaction with their purchase.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, the **Fire TV Stick 4K**, rated at 4.5/5 based on 3,070 reviews, is the superior choice for those seeking high-definition content and added convenience. With faster loading times and improved performance, this model excels in delivering a seamless entertainment experience. Users praise the device's compatibility with various applications and its stunning visual presentation. As one satisfied customer stated, \"the pictures are crystal clear on the screen [it] looks so live!\"\n",
            "\n",
            "However, both models share one significant limitation – neither supports YouTube TV directly. If you're considering switching from Sling TV to YouTube TV, be aware that Amazon's devices won't accommodate this change without purchasing alternative streaming devices such as Roku.\n",

            "Now, let's address the least favorably reviewed product in our comparison: **Product B07FZ8S74R**. With a total of 2,023 reviews and an average rating of 4.6/5, this product isn't technically a streaming media player, but an Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation. Although many users appreciate its functionality, including hands-free control with Alexa, the device lacks the capability to stream video or audio content natively.

            "It seems Nest has a lot of mixed reviews across their ever growing product line. I first jumped on the Nest bandwagon about two years ago with the 2nd generation Nest Thermostat and shortly after picked up a couple Dropcams. Nest then released their highly controversial Nest Protects and I immediately bought five of them for my house. I only had an issue with one of them since and Nest has stepped up to the plate and shown their customer service can be top notch. My excitement only grew when they took over Dropcam.<br /><br />As soon as Nest pulled a quick one and announced the 3rd generation thermostat, I had to buy it. On paper it seems just as an evolutionary upgrade should be. Larger screen, better display and thinner profile amongst them. A lot of people seemed to again jump on Nest for this &#34;minimal&#34; upgrade but it's what I've wanted from them since I purchased my gen 2.<br /><br />My thermostat came a bit earlier then I expected from Amazon and I was thrilled to install it. It literally took me three minutes to get my old Nest thermostat off the wall and the new one installed and power back on to my Furnace/AC. I left the original metal backplate on my wall as the new plastic backplate mated just fine to it. The back of the Nest connector plate is slightly different so I had to use that but the wiring was identical from my 2nd gen. Upon turning everything up and following the quick setup on the Nest it pulled an update and it was on and ready. A simple setup through the Nest app on my iPhone and it was connected immediately to my phone and connected Nest products. It's amazing how such small changes can be so huge. This new nest thermostat looks great and activates the display without hitch when walking by. Here is to hoping nest is able to add many more requested features within software updates. I'll also be looking into purchasing the new 2nd gen Protects.<br /><br />Bottom line; If you adore tech and love your Nest products this is a no brainer. If you're happy with your 2nd gen, I see no immediate reason to upgrade but it is such a beautiful device. If you're on the fence and you've got a completely different thermostat, go check it out and see what you think. My guess is you'll also be purchasing more Nest products down the road!\n",
            "check with your furnace person before you buy this.  paid for 3 visits by an expert and they said that because it does not create it own power, will not work with many units.  $600 later I have a nest that will not work.  He commented that this is a very old design that other manufacturers eliminated 20 years ago because of issue they had.\n",
            "Definitely recommand this product. I have a separate heating and cooling system. Gas furnace heating hot water which is sent to a radiator in the attic. A single blower is used for heating and cooling.<br />Pros:<br />Conpatibility app is great, It gives anyone the knowledge they need to ensure compatibility and gives you the confidence you need to complete the install on your own.<br />Very easy install with added instruction manual, included wire labels, and on line videos<br />On phone tech support was excellent<br />Iphone (and mac book pro) apps are the best, no more getting up in the middle of the night to lower or raise the thermostat<br />Kids think it's the coolest<br /><br />Cons:<br />Price, it's not cheap<br />Chat support was not technical enough, in the end they gave me false information. Could have burned out my heating coil if I didn't call tech support<br />Problem, out of the box the system does not turn on the fan when the heat comes on. Has to be modified by a tech. Luckily, phone support walked me through some advanced settings to turn on this feature. Very easy to do if you know where it is.<br />Problem, When the heat goes off the blower goes off. Should have a setting that keeps it on for say 5 or 10 minutes.<br />Inconvenience, after making the change above the fan icon is not displayed on the thermostat, iPhone, Mac apps. Worried about burning out my coil I keep checking just to make sure.\n",

            "Mine arrived yesterday; timely, in good shape, as expected.<br /><br />The photo is a bit deceptive, or at least incomplete.<br />See, the photo makes it look like plastic, but it's not. It's salt. It's heavy, rough, and irregular. It's a big chunk of salt.<br /><br />Instructions say to clean it with a damp cloth but I'm not sure that's practical. It's pretty rough. More importantly, it casts light<br />the color of the photo. The light is very warm, very orange. It's NICE, but don't buy it if you don't want a warm light.<br /><br />Also, the power cord is black. I'm dressing the cord along a white shelf against a white wall and would have wanted to know that.<br /><br />Health benefits given the whole 'ion' thing? Not sure. I mostly wanted to warn you it has a black power cord. I like it plenty, and will buy one as a gift.<br />It's really pretty awesome, looks great. I might even buy another for myself. No complaint at all (except for the doggoned black power cord!)\n",
            "I had taken my son to visit his pediatrician and she had one of these salt lamps in every exam room. Prior to this visit, the rooms had a typical doctors office smell-not offensive but they do treat ill children there! At this visit, the exam rooms didn't have the previous odor and it was attributed to the salt lamps. As we have 2 cats and 2 dogs and allergy issues I thought we would try using these lamps at home. Now the house smells fresher and the allergies have subsided! Another plus is that the salt lamps cast a warm glow and we have eliminated using any nightlights. We will be giving these as gifts to our loved ones this year!!\n",

            "I have bought and used a LOT of flashlights in my life. This is the best one I ever owned. But I bought it from Ebay. They had a better deal.<br /><br />This adventure began by seeing a repeated commercial on TV about a super bright flashlight that you can even run over with your car and it still works. So I was attracted but fortunately I did my research on Goodle and discovered the TV flashlight had a lot of negative reviews.<br /><br />I can say a great deal about this the J5 Tactical. It's not the brightest. 300 lumens compared with phsically larger flashlights with 600 lumens. This is not an issue. This flashlight is VERY bright and you can focus it. When you focus to the max you don't see a round circle anymore, instead you see a square element projected brightly on the surface of the wall. I didn't like this. Still don't.<br /><br />You have to buy a battery and charger for the battery separately. Be advised. It uses a 3.7 volt battery. Looks like an AA battery, but in reality the battery is slightly bigger that AA. You can't use a AA with this flashlight. Also I found a better price with both battery and battery charger on Ebay.<br /><br />The flashlight has three modes. Bright, a little less bright, and strobe. Other flashlights have more modes, like SOS, with you don't need and give you more things you have to cycle through to get what you want. Here simplicity is good.<br /><br />The flashlight is SMALL, and therefore VERY easy to keep with you at all times. You see that little clip there on the image where the flashlight fastens to your pocket it wherever. It's VERY strong, and VERY stiff and tight. A little too stiff and tight. You can't just clip it in  your shirt pocket because of that. But stick it in your pants pocket or whatever because it's small light solid as a rock and very lightweight.<br /><br />All in all, the best and favorite flashlight I've ever owned.\n",
            "The flashlight has a high intensity beam. However, after about a week of use the controls began to switch back and forth on their own while I was using it. It would start flashing, then go dim without me resetting it. It seems the internal control mechanisms are faulty or improperly constructed. I would not buy this flashlight again.\n",
            "Meh. Cheap light, not very bright. But not very expensive either. Does not even come close to my Fenix lights, but only cost 1/5. A good disposable light.\n",

Wish we had these at work!<br /><br />Do your hiney a favor and just hit the buy button,  I have an older toilet and toilet seat and it sits flush just like it used to,  no wobbles.<br /><br />But be warned do NOT turn the pressure halfway up first try,  it will literally feel like a pressure washer ripping into your you know what. Please poo responsibly!\n",
            "This is a super great product, and I highly recommend it. Functionally, it is a very simple, but elegant design and works great. I was initially concerned that a cold-water only bidet would be unpleasant, but I have not found that to be the case (full disclosure: I live in Southern California, so the cold water tap is never ice cold, as I imagine it might be in other parts of the country). I also thought I would regret not having the air dryer feature found on more expensive electric bidets, but that is also not the case - a little toilet paper gets the job done very easily and much more quickly.<br /><br />However, installation did not come without some hiccups. My toilet is a Toto with a plastic seat. As with most plastic seats, the underside of the seat has a lip that descends down towards the bowel. I found that when lowering the seat, the lip hit the top of the bidet, preventing the seat from going down all the way. The clever slotted mounting holes in the bidet allowed me to adjust the position of the bidet relative to the seat so that this problem could be avoided, but doing so prevented the bidet's nozzle from descending, as now it would hit the back side of the toilet bowel. There was no compromise position that worked, so I had to change out the seat for a wooden one (most of which have a flat underside with no lip). However, the first wooden seat I bought would not work because the seat's hinge was thick where it attached to the underside of the seat, so that it would hit the top of the bidet and prevent the seat's front edge from resting on the edge of the toilet bowel. Sitting on it would have likely damaged the bidet. While the problem seems obvious in hindsight, it actually wasn't at the time. I called Luxe's customer support line for help and the service I got was outstanding. The agent had me take a couple pictures and email them while I was on the phone with her and she quickly diagnosed the problem. She then immediately emailed me back a list of several seats on Amazon that she said would work. As I didn't want to wait 2 days for the seat to arrive, and as I was concerned that the problem I had with the nozzle hitting the backside of the toilet bowel might occur with some of the suggested seats, I ran out to my local big-box hardware store and found a seat that would definitely work, since it was wood (with no descending lip), and it was obvious the hinge would not touch the top of the bidet.<br /><br />While having to replace my toilet seat added some expense to the project, the total cost is still way less than most bidets that come with their own seat attached, and well worth the price for what you get in the end (no pun intended).\n",

            "Haven't even used it for a week and already ripping at the top seam... just regular use of going in and out.. not running through it,  no animals jumping on it or anything. Really upset\n",

            "I bought this screen a year ago to install at my back door.  I have several large dogs so providing access to the backyard while preventing flies from coming in was critical.  The screen was super easy to install, took MAYBE 30 minutes start to finish. And it didn't take long at all for the dogs to figure out they could run through the screen whenever they wanted. So far, excellent buy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the dogs not only run through the screen, they tear at the bottom. I tried to just fix it with duct tape but their tears have now rendered the screen ridiculous. I'm going to buy another one and try sewing fabric along the bottom 12\" to prevent them from ripping the screen itself. We'll see if that works.<br /><br />Another thing to note, make sure you don't have anything the magnets would be attracted to near the door.  I have a washer and dryer near the door so when the dogs run in and flick the screen up, it frequently sticks to the dryer instead of falling back into place. Great to hold the door open for them, but also holds the door open for the flies. Not so good.<br /><br />Obviously, I'm about to buy a second one so I must have liked the first one. Let's just say it doesn't come without its challenges.\n",

            "The Nest Learning Thermostat boasts an impressive average rating of 4.1/5, backed by 332 reviews. With its modern design and user-friendly interface, the smart thermostat allows users to remotely monitor and manage temperature settings via the Nest app. One satisfied customer praises the device's \"simple setup,\" \"excellent on-phone tech support,\" and \"amazing device.\" However, caution is necessary regarding its compatibility with specific types of heating systems.

            "\n",
            "2. Himalayan Pink Salt Lamp (B001892AX2):\n",

Its distinctive appearance appeals to many, who appreciate its natural aesthetic and therapeutic qualities. The lamp requires minimal maintenance, as stated by one buyer, who noted the improvement in air quality and reduction of allergens.

Additionally, the lamp's black power cord poses a concern for those seeking a matching decorative element.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. V1-PRO Flashlight (Not Provided):\n",
            "Boasting a remarkable average rating of 4.5/5 based on 290 reviews, the V1-PRO Flashlight stands out for its ultra-bright LED output and versatile functionality. Users praise the flashlight's durability, ease of use, and exceptional value.

            "\n",
            "Top Complaints:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Nest Learning Thermostat (B0131RG6VK):\n",
            "Some common criticisms of the Nest Learning Thermostat include its relatively high price tag, lackluster chat support, and occasional glitches, such as the failure to activate the fan function when the heat turns off. For instance, one user mentioned receiving incorrect information from chat support, potentially leading to further complications.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Himalayan Pink Salt Lamp (B001892AX2):\n",
            "Despite its overall positivity, some customers express disappointment concerning the lamp's fragility and the presence of a black power cord. Others note the difficulty of cleaning the lamp, particularly due to its porous nature and tendency to attract dust and dirt.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. V1-PRO Flashlight (Not Provided):\n",
            "Users have reported problems with the flashlight's internal components, specifically referring to controls that malfunction or fail to maintain consistent performance. Additionally, a few individuals mentioned experiencing automatic mode switches, affecting their desired usage patterns.\n",
            "\n",
            "Worst Product:\n",
            "Among the reviewed products, none stand out as the absolute worst. Instead, it appears that each product presents its unique set of pros and cons, allowing consumers to weigh their preferences and priorities accordingly.\n",

            "When considering purchases in the Tools_and_Home_Improvement category, understanding the nuances of individual products is crucial.

I was ecstatic because I have been having chronic ache for more than 10 years. I continued to use it 3 times per day for the next 7-10days. It was fantastic! The pain was almost gone! At the same time I applied the cream one time on my other 3 brothers at around 8.30pm: 1 with lower backache for more than 10 years, 1 shoulder blade ache, 1 heel bone ache due to gout. All said the pain was almost 80% gone before they slept at about 11-12pm!<br /><br />Happily I continued using it. However, after about 10 days, the pain somehow came back slowly over the next few days. Eventually pain is back to its original intensity.<br />I don't understand why. I really hope the cream work. Penetrex what happens?\n",
            "This is one truly helpful therapy cream. Penetrex helps control my mothers arthritis flare ups. It aids in my mothers comfort in just a few minutes and gives me peace of mind. Thank you BioMax Health Products for a real product that works!\n",
            "I first purchased CT Cream over 12 years ago when I was suffering with Carpal Tunnel in both hands. Two Doctors suggested I change my job due to the constant repetitive action I did. Changing jobs was not going to happen, so I started searching. This product works. It helps tolerate aches and pain as it heals and also found that it heals bruises much faster. When my young son hurts or aches, he asks for the cream. My daughter is a fan of CT Cream also, she uses it for muscle aches and puts it on her temples and the back of her neck when she has a headache.<br />  I needed to reorder and found &quot;Penetrex&quot; and decided to try it since it was made by the same company, Biomax Health Products. I really like the Penetrex, it penetrates into the skin without any greasy feeling. I don't like walking around smelling like medicine, Penetrex has a nice almost yummy smell that goes away in a few minutes after applying. This product is absolutely wonderful!<br /><br />I have shared both products with my friends and family. My friend recently had an IV in her hand which left it looking badly bruised due to bleeding under the skin. She used Penetrex on it and it was healed and totally gone in less than a week. She also found her arthritis was more manageable. Her husband has bad headaches, she rubbed some Penetrex on his neck and shoulders and asked him a little later how his headache was...he was amazed, it was gone. I gave my jar of Penetrex to them.<br /><br />As far as both products goes, I find the Penetrex like an upgrade to the CT Cream. I will be sharing a jar of Penetrex with my daughter, her CT Cream is almost gone.\n",

            "This beautifully styled ultrasonic diffuser really pumps out the mist. Also, it has a lot of interesting features, that I have found unique to this model.  If you are comparing diffusers, trying to make up your mind, here's some points you might want to consider with this model. For starters, it has a warning sound for low water level, power up, and so on. Many diffusers don't come with a measuring cup for the water, URPOWER's diffuser has one. It might seem like a small point, until you have unplugged the wire from your diffuser, to go to the sink to get water, about a 100 times. Suddenly, its the little things that make all the difference in convenience. The LED nightlight function, provides a lot of different choices, for the light's color and intensity. When you click the LIGHT button, it toggles thru 1. kaleidoscope colors, constantly morphing thru the rainbow 2. dark red  3. bright red  3. dark blue  4. bright blue 5. dark yellow, and so on, including white, until it finally turns the light back off. So you can select morphing colors, or find your favorite color, or even chose the color for some &#34;light healing&#34; that corresponds to the essential oil you are evaporating. (Peppermint is green, Orange oil is orange, Lavender is violet, Rose is red, Eucalyptus is blue....I'm sure you see where I'm going with this.) The power button has a start up mode, with a green indicator light, and an operational mode, with a red indicator. If the unit runs dry, it powers off. So no need to worry, what will happen if it runs out of water during the night. Nothing happens, it just turns off. Finally, the diffuser includes a clearly written, very thorough instruction booklet.. Even though it only has two buttons, the light button and the power button, people have questions about the operation, the maintenance, or  like to keep handy a troubleshooting list. URPOWER is a consistently good company, with well made products, from my experience. They include a one year warranty with this model, which I'm sure they'd stand behind.<br /><br />A WORD ABOUT AROMATHERAPY<br />I've been practicing aromatherapy for about 25 years. You start out with 6 oils, and before you know it, you have 30 different fragrances, and you're creating your own mixes to treat all kinds of illnesses of mind, body and spirit. You never want to try to diffuse those cheap &#34;fragrance oils&#34;. Those will only create a nasty film, and gunk up your diffuser's ultrasonic ceramic disk. Only buy 100% pure essential oils, for your diffuser. Of course, any scent that you connect to, is the best scent for you. Find a health food store, or even a large supermarket with a health food section, and you'll find an aromatherapy display with tester bottles. Smell a few, then stop. The nose can only recognize a new scent, for so long. (We acclimatize to smell so fast.) If you don't live somewhere near a health food store, or you just want to delve right in, I recommend one of those &#34;Essential oil starter kits&#34;, with 6 or 8 different oils. (These kits usually contain Lavender, Peppermint, Orange, Eucalyptus, and maybe Lemongrass or Tea Tree oil.) Personally, I might buy the Lavender, Peppermint, Orange, Eucalyptus, but add a couple of more expensive oils that are typically used for incense. For example, Myrrh, patchouli, pine, or a personal favorite, cedarwood oil. Its inexpensive, and has a lot of benefits, including being a bug repellent. If you want to use your diffuser on your back porch, and have problems with mosquitos, why not consider buying some citronella oil? Instead of orange oil, a more subtle scent is orange blossom, or even bergamot oil. (A favorite blend for headaches, is the classical version of eau de cologne, which is lavender oil 3 drops, bergamot or orange oil 3 drops, and 3 drops of rosemary oil. It rids you of headaches in a jiffy.) If you really start to get interested in the subject of aromatherapy, or even the history of perfumery, and incense, there are no shortages of books to purchase. Its like any other art form. If you start to learn to play an instrument, your ear will develop more sensitivity to sounds, to the beauty within all types of sounds, and the relationships of one note to another. The same is true of aromatherapy. In fact, musical language is used to describe the scents. A top note is the most easily detected scent, and most easily evaporated. (Like bergamot oil). The bottom note, or bass note, last the longest, and as in music, ties together all the other scents in a mix. (Patchouli and sandalwood oil, are both bottom notes.) You can just dip your toe in the water, and get a bottle of lavender oil for relaxing, and a bottle of peppermint oil for colds, or to perk up, or you can discover the amazing world of scent all around you. Best of luck on your adventure. If you have questions, just post in the comments, and I'll try to answer them for you.<br />I was provided a free aromatherapy diffuser in exchange for an honest review.\n",
            "One of my favorite products bought on Amazon. This thing is awesome. I was never in to essential oils, but when I got this, I now have to try all of them. I love having it next to my bed and breathing it in at night, especially the eucalyptus &amp; pine oils. It is also very calming to look at. One fill up lasts me about 4 hours on the red continuous setting, which is really all I use.\n",
            "I bought this little unit to use in my classroom. It has done a yeoman's job! The kids love the scents, and I must say, it sure beats the smell of &#34;wet puppy dogs&#34; after recess!\n",

I couldn't eat or drink anything. it took me 4 hours to drink an 8oz bottle of water and i threw that up too! Almost ended up in the ER for dehydration. I am a normal, healthy young adult and could not tolerate being this sick. I only read reviews afterward from people who really did faint or end up in the ER from this product! DO NOT TAKE/ BUY.

I also experienced zero positive benefits during the 3 days I tried to tough it out. Save your money and try natural, home remedies first!!!\n",

            "I really hate to write this review because I wanted to badly to love this scale. This scale was ok for a while, but I just never felt like it was quite right. I bought it because of the reviews and because it was a #1 seller. I read multiple times about how accurate it was, but I unfortunately didn't find that to be true. To start out with, the scale would be different by a pound or two each time I stepped on it.  I would just have to average the weights to find what my weight might be. But this made it difficult for tracking weight loss.  Lately, the swing has been swinging WILDLY in different directions. I can step on the scale and get a weight, step on it immediately after and it will be 20 pounds heavier. I step on it again and it's 10 pounds off from that. One day I stepped on it 10 times and it was different every single time. And it was just a pound here or a pound there, it was off 5 pounds from the previous weight every time. I'm working hard on losing weight and this has made it almost impossible for me to track it.  I have done everything I can think of to fix it, thinking maybe it was something that could be fixed. I changed the batteries. I put it on a different surface. Nothing worked. I'm just sorely disappointed and I don't want to be :-/\n",
            "How can this product be rated as #1 from 14,117 users 5 years in a row? I usually gauge my purchase by what previous customers had to say about the product. I guess I was wrong this time.  I gave this product ample time to prove its accuracy but I can't seem to get that. I followed basic instructions on using digital scales. But this scale is just inaccurate. I weighed my self initially, waited at lest 30 - 45 minutes while I drank 16oz of water, then i stepped on the scale.  How can I weigh less even after consuming 16oz plus of water.  So I compared the scale on how close it compares to my doctor's scale. 5 to 6 lbs difference, + - 1. Sometimes I wonder, how are these ratings even posted on Amazon. My money was refunded after I returned the product.\n",
            "this scale remembers the last weight and will display it, if it is close to the new weight (rather than actually reweighing the object)<br />the only way to reweigh something to check the accuracy is to fool it by weighing something else of a different weight and then reweighing the object<br />I assume this has something to do with it's remembering the last zero point so that you don't have to rezero it before you weigh yourself<br />not what you want a scale to do\n",

            "We have been using this Etekcity digital scale for a year now in our our home are very pleased with the scale so far. We had purchased this scale to replace our previous Sunbeam manual , Spring loaded bathroom scale which was horribly inaccurate and deliberated for a considerable amount of time between this scale and the FitBit Aria smart scale . In the end because of the huge price difference and very positive reviews on this scale made us go with this one<br /><br />Design, Construction & Build<br />-------------------------------------<br />- The scale is feels heavy for its size mainly due to the thick, monolithic glass sheet stepping surface of the scale<br />- All our fears or cracked or broken glass due to stepping on it frequently, bumping or dropping it were unfounded in the past year ( we did all of them !)  , so its definitely sturdy and well built<br />- The two tone black-sliver finish on the scale looks ultra modern and chic<br />- The digital readouts are large and backlit in a pleasant not-too-strong blue which is visible both in light and complete darkness. I often check my weight on the scale during midnight bathroom visits.<br /><br />Long Term Accuracy<br />---------------------------<br />- When we initially purchased this scale i used a 10 lb Rice bag to measure its accuracy and it was always within 0.2 lb of 10 lb  with repeated tests, which is very accurate for a digital scale and well suited for measuring body weight<br />- Another pointer to the accuracy  of this scale is that the weight that we got for our toddler son from his pediatrician using a professional balance scale matches the results we got from this scale<br /><br />I tried the same accuracy test today after a whole year of use & abuse:<br />10 lb Basmati Rice Bag :  Scale Measured  = 10.4 lb<br />6lb  Dumbbells  :  Scale Measured  = 5.8 lb<br /><br />As you can see that even after one year the scale is fairly accurate , for all I know it might be 100% accurate as well as I have no way of certifying that the 10lb rice bag or the dumbbells are infact their true stated weights.<br /><br />Battery Life<br />----------------<br />- The scale is still using the two original AAA that came with the package even after a year of frequent, daily use  so I'd say its great!<br /><br />Cons<br />----------<br />-  About the only con about this scale is that the glass surface, being glass, needs frequent cleaning as it shows water stains. we usually wipe it with a damp cloth once every week so its not too bad. If you are going worry about keeping it spotless always then you'll going to have a hard time :)<br /><br />Overall we are very pleased with our purchase and couple of our family friends have also purchased it after seeing it in our home and can highly recommend this scale if your are looking for a good looking , inexpensive and accurate digital scale.\n",
            "Wish that I read the other low reviews first... I get weights that vary 6 pounds within a couple of minutes, even with following instructions\n",
            "This scale is slim and sleek, which is cool. What's odd about it is that nine times out of ten, it tells me a wrong weight first (usually about three pounds over, give or take), then I step off, then it flashes &#34;C&#34;, then I go again and it gives me the right weight. I've gotten used to it as a quirk, but it's weird.<br /><br />Also-- make sure you're always using on a hard, flat surface. I first tried it on a rug and got very confusing results.<br /><br />ETA: This has basically stopped working. I weighed myself five times this morning and got a different weight (within a four-pound range, but I'm fairly sure none of them were close to right) every time. It was good while it lasted but I expect something like this to last more than ten months.\n",

            "\n",
            "In the vast landscape of health and household products, two stand out for their remarkable ability to provide relief and rejuvenation – Penetrex and CT Cream. Both offer impressive customer testimonials, making it challenging for consumers to decide which one suits their needs best. Let's embark on a journey through the world of these powerful topical treatments, exploring their similarities, differences, and addressing common concerns.\n",
            "\n",
            "Firstly, let's discuss Penetrex, a therapeutic cream praised for its efficacy in managing chronic pain conditions such as arthritis, lower back pain, and various musculoskeletal disorders. Users report experiencing significant improvements within days of usage, with many noting its quick absorption and delightful scent. Some individuals have even shared success stories of passing along their Penetrex jars to loved ones, resulting in similar experiences.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, some customers express disappointment upon realizing that the pain returns after initial improvement. Though the exact reason for this recurrence remains unknown, it may warrant further investigation regarding the potential need for consistent applications or perhaps longer treatment durations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, we encounter CT Cream, a versatile solution favored by those dealing with carpal tunnel syndrome, muscle aches, and even headaches. With a reputation for quick healing properties and excellent smell, CT Cream offers a reliable alternative for those seeking topical pain relief.\n",
            "\n",
            "The primary complaint surrounding CT Cream revolves around inconsistent performance. While some users praise its effectiveness, others mention the absence of noticeable changes despite diligent use. This discrepancy highlights the importance of individual responses to specific products.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, let's address the elephant in the room – a product that should never cross your shopping cart threshold: Product B00ISAPPLI. This mysterious item, hidden under the guise of a \"health supplement,\" garnered numerous reports of extreme side effects, ranging from intense nausea and vomiting to severe abdominal cramps. These accounts serve as a stark reminder of the importance of thoroughly researching unfamiliar products and trusting reputable sources before consumption.\n",
            "\n",
            "Though both Penetrex and CT Cream exhibit remarkable capabilities in relieving pain and promoting overall wellness, the path to choosing the ideal solution lies in understanding personal preferences and requirements. Whether seeking quick relief for targeted pain areas or a multi-purpose solution for everyday aches and bruises, either option may hold the key to unlocking a life free from discomfort.\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember, consult with healthcare professionals whenever incorporating new treatments into your routine, ensuring a holistic approach to maintaining optimal health and vitality.\n"

(another $30-$60) so $60-$90 to return?  Better be sure before you purchase.<br /><br />Update 4/12/2015:<br /><br />I kept the pot and use it regularly. I did learn how to make great rice with it, and as long as you keep a few constraints in mind it becomes easier to work with.  One thing their marketing doesn't prepare you for is how long it takes to get things to and from the pressure cooking cycle. It can take ten to fifteen minutes for it to warm up to the point that your actual advertised cooking time begins. Then there is typically a ten minute cool down period at the end. Once you make peace with those facts then using the pot just becomes part of your cooking workflow. Good luck.\n",
            "It does not contain non-stickable container! The first time in my life that I see a rice cooker with no teflon (non-stickable container)! So disappointing!\n",
            "Dear Instant Pot:<br /><br />I will not test you any more. I truly love you and will go to any extent to keep you safe and happy with me. I take you to be my beloved companion from this day forward for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part!!<br /><br />- Yours truly<br />I was at my wit's end with my pressure cooker. I am Indian, have a high pressure full-time job and I have a toddler to take care of. I like to cook and cook a lot. I can literally count the number of times we eat out per year. My husband is Vegan and I have tested and tried several recipes successfully but have always wished some brilliant mind would design a pressure cooker that is exactly like the Instant Pot -<br /><br />Stainless steel (for healthy cooking), easy to clean manually (this takes less than a minute to wash!), dishwasher safe, easy to understand settings, large (to cook for a large gathering), no mess at all on the cooker's lid (versus a huge mess that I have been dealing with for years now), cooks really fast, cooks really slow (when I want that - in 'slow cooker' mode), is a rice cooker/pressure cooker/slow cooker/soup pot - all in one!!<br /><br />The Instant Pot is just that and much more. It has several cooking modes (Steam, saute, multigrain, pressure cooking, slow cooking, yogurt maker) and a ton of other settings. It has been a big hit so far with every single thing I have tried. I have tried making brown rice in different rice cookers and in several different pressure cookers which almost always used to end up in a mess. At the end of it, the brown rice would not even be cooked. I almost had told myself that I would never end up making brown rice successfully my entire life. With almost &#34;no effort&#34; at all on my part, I have been making brown rice in the Instant Pot and it has been turning out so well!<br /><br />Being Indians, lentils ('dals') are a staple food. Both the lid and the base of my old pressure cooker would get messed up almost every time I used it. The 'dal' would not get cooked but we had to spend a lot of time scrubbing the lid as well as the base of the cooker. The Instant Pot is a blessing. Anything I say about it is not going to be enough. You have to buy and see the difference yourself as it works its magic. I have tried making several curries, steaming veggies, etc and it was magical - at least for me.<br /><br />The only drawback I see is that someone with less counter space in the kitchen may find this to be a little bulky. I am big into style and looks and tend to go for contemporary styling with the smallest of things I buy. Instant Pot is the only exception to that. Because of how much it can simplify your life, I am okay with this looking a little bulky. Despite the fact that it takes up space, I would recommend this to anyone because if you own this, you should be able to give away multiple cookers/appliances that you may own. The Instant Pot can easily replace a slow cooker + a pressure cooker + a rice cooker and probably a few more appliances/cookers you may own. I have not even been using my stove top and the usual pans that I used quite frequently (before) ever since Instant Pot came into my life. Most of cooking happens inside the IP.  You will love it too.\n",

            "i did a lot of research on humidifiers, mostly by reading a lot of reviews describing the perils and pitfalls of all the models ...<br />Competing products may be fine also, but i am happy with this one for the following reasons:<br />1) very quiet<br />2)  spits out a clean , consistent cool mist<br />3)  has a nice soft light (optional to have it on)<br />4)  Runs at the highest speed for more than 12 hours<br />5)  its small and weighs very little.  perfect for my room (12'x14')<br /><br />the only knock is the cleaning, but i am guessing every humidifier has to be cleaned in some manner.  the product is basically 2 pieces.  the tank part (blue) can only be cleaned by filling it with water and vinegar and letting it sit-  which is kind of annoying.  They give you a very small brush, but its not really useful for cleaning the long cylindrical tube because it is fully enclosed in the tank.  would be easier to clean if this product could be taken apart in more places.\n",
            "Bottom line: The tank leaked its contents all over our floor. Despite several attempts, this humidifier is useless at best and damaging to our home at worst.<br /><br />Here's the back story: My 5 month old son and I were recently diagnosed with COVID, and to avoid exposure, my husband and our 2 year old temporarilly moved out. So, I was home alone with an infant, and both of us were very ill. Luckily, I had just purchased this humidifier! I set it up when I put my son to sleep at night and it appeared to be working well... so far, so good. I came back a couple hours later and the floor was a little wet. No worries, I thought... I must have spilled a small glass of water. Again, I came back a couple hours after that and found that the entire humidifier tank had emptied onto our hardwood and rugs. To avoid potentially damaging the floors and rug, I immediately started cleaning up the mess. In the middle of the night. In the dark. While caring for an infant with COVID. While also suffering from COVID myself. I can assure you, it was a low point.<br /><br />After that, I put the humidifier away so that I could address it when my family was healthy and reunited. Well, I plugged it in yesterday to test it out and the same thing happened. Plugged it in, appeared to be working just fine, and came back a couple hours later to the tank leaking everywhere. This humidifier is faulty and let us down when we needed it most. We had a humidifier that worked great a few years ago... I'm going to re-purchase that one instead, and I'd recommend you do the same.\n",

            "850 grams of awesomeness is NOT 536 grams of sub-par fluff.<br /><br />The 850 gram pillow I got back in November 2020.  It's amazing, worth $40 for 2.  The gel foam is heavy, kinda cool, soft and supportive.  Everything you want which is why I repurchased.<br /><br />But then I got this *gestures at still flat, lightweight, $5 target quality pillows*.  If I wanted cheap and easy I would have gone to target.  I wanted supportive,  cool, heavy, premium.<br /><br />It takes a LOT to get an introvert to call Amazon, get a refund, AND go to the post office to send them back.  These pillows are that bad that I will go to the post office and talk to people.  Do better.\n",
            "A few reviewers said there was hair inside a sealed pillow. I frankly believed that would be a rare or unusual complaint....that has never happened to me, ever.  So, my first Beckham pillow and I find dark, short strands of coarse hair on both sides of the pillow inside the sealed bag.  The pillow appears clean, except for the hair, but I don't want to use it and I don't want to stuff the now very large pillow into a small container to send it back.  The second pillow is clean, no hair, so I'll put one of my zipper pillow protectors on it before the pillowcase and I'll do the same with the hair laden pillow but will give that to the cat...wasting an additional pillow protector.  I'm a bit squeamish about these pillows which were to be a treat for me so I am very disappointed.\n",
            "After Reading many positive reviews I decided to try these pillows. While they were shipping before they arrived I read some reviews complaining about the quality over the last few years having declined so I was a drop skeptical when I first tried it. At first I only tried one pillow had an excellent night sleep but thought that perhaps it wasn’t stuffed enough. Then I slept on it another few nights and I was sold – started using both pillows discarded old ones that they were placed and knew I had found my perfect pillows. These are excellent quality just the right balance of stuffed supportive and plush comfort. I’ve been sleeping much better and I’m thrilled with this purchase.\n",

            "Can I express my love for a vacuum? I shall!<br /><br />This vacuum is top notch! I use it daily! And by using it daily, I mean I carry it around when I'm bored and suck dust off of random crap. I was a sheltered child, we didn't have portable vacuums. We had big clunky 200lb Hoover dam vacuums.<br /><br />It also scares the bejesus out of my dog, so there's that. It's like, miniaturize your worst fear. But leave all the potency. Like a bee with the venom of king cobra. I think that's how my dog feels.I've attached a photo of my dog so you know which one to pray for in my boredom.\n",
            "Once I received my \"new\" Lithium Ion Dust Buster, I have to agree with the majority of the reviews.  This dust buster was well designed, easy to operate, great suction, easy to clean and most of all, the battery life is fantastic.  I've had Nicad dust busters in the past and they just don't last very long and our most recent one the charger burned out.  Right now, the only negative (and this has been pointed out by other reviewers) is the bright blue LED charging light.  This light is flashing while in charge mode and steady when fully charged.  It's best to keep this charger in a room where you won't see it if you're trying to sleep, eat or watch TV - a bit obnoxious. This light is too bright.  A non-LED light would have made more sense.  We can deal with the light issue so this product gets a full 5 stars.  I would also recommend that Amazon make available the filter that goes with this hand vac.  the one's shown do not fit this unit.  From what I've seen so far, you can only get another filter through Black & Decker and there is no filter part number in the manual.\n",
            "I live in a 200 sq ft dorm room with hard flooring and have been using this as my primary (only) vacuum since December 2016.  I vacuum and mop my whole floor a couple times a semester and vacuum various bits of floor once or twice a month once they start feeling gritty.  At first it worked great -- suction is good and the thin nozzle gets under and around my weird furniture.<br /><br />Things I have used this vacuum to suck up and dispose of: dirt, dust, lint, miscellaneous food crumbs, long human hair (mine), live ants, live silverfish, cockroach legs.  (Nozzle wasn't quite big enough to handle the whole cockroach.  I have many unwanted insectoid roommates.)  It also cleaned a large pile of dirt off the cruddy dorm carpet I had in my previous room, for what that's worth.  (This would be the carpet you always get in dorms and hotels that's permanently off-grey and texturally equivalent to Velcro, so the pile was not particularly thick.)<br /><br />I store the vacuum on the charging base.  I found out that apparently leaving the vacuum on the charger for extended periods of time kills the battery, so now the vacuum will operate with good suction for about 5 minutes at a stretch, but then needs to be recharged.  [RANT INCOMING: skip rest of paragraph if you don't want to read it.]  This annoys me profoundly, because one of the reasons I bought this vacuum is because the base holds the vacuum upright and gives it a nice small storage footprint (see above: 200 sq ft dorm room).  Personally, I feel like if a product comes in a box with a charging base, and the box art shows the product being stored sitting nicely on the base, you should actually be able to store the product sitting nicely on the base.  I should also note that we wouldn't be having this problem if Black & Decker had designed this product with slightly better lithium-ion battery charging circuitry.<br /><br />Three stars: worked great up until it didn't.  Since I apparently haven't learned my lesson, I'll be replacing it with the newer & cheaper Black & Decker HHVI315JO42, and this time I'll be careful not to store it on the charger for too long.\n",

            "Though I bought this earlier I didn't start using it until January and once I learned how to fill it I loved it.  However it's already making loud unusual sounds when I turn it on.  Almost like a grinding sound making it unusable.\n",
            "[[VIDEOID:3b40f8834df200aabdcaae0ed9787ad0]] I just received this item a few days ago and in the middle of using it, it just stopped working. I believe the fan that is supposed to blow the water vapor out of the machine is broken. As you can see from the video, it does produce most, but does not come out of the machine. Such a bummer that the quality of this humidifier is not good. I will be returning this.\n",
            "[[VIDEOID:2303a05fb2eab5289c0bd94acbc8f8d9]] I definitely would buy this again. It was so easy to put together and it doesn’t make noise that’ll keep you up. It definitely works as far as the humidity. I wake up and my respiratory feels sooo much better than without it. I keep it on the lowest setting and it still works. A little bit smaller than expected but definitely a must have in your bedroom.\n",
